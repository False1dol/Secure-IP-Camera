## Abstract 
###### The evolution of video surveillance technology towards network-based systems has marked the prominent trend in the security industry. It serves various functional and financial benefits to corporations in order to better protect their assets and personnel. The development of networked Internet Protocol (IP) surveillance has enabled increased accessibility and security while reducing the costs of traditional CCTV systems. However, IP cameras have been proven to be susceptible to hacks once the network integrity is compromised. This necessitates methods to secure IP cameras against such malicious attempts.

###### The project aims to develop a hardware module to secure IP cameras by adopting the concept of End-to-Display Encryption (E2DE), which has been developed and researched by the University of Tuebingen, Germany. E2DE enables data security at endpoints by extending the protection of End-to-End encryption to beyond the communication endpoint by using pixel-domain data instead of raw application data, through decryption done between the computer and the display.

###### The proposed module will encode the camera stream such that the stream can be decoded only by users who are granted access through the E2DE receiver of their display. Even if the stream is accessed by an eavesdropping attack, the hacker will only see the encoded stream and will not be able to decode it without having the required key for the E2DE receiver. As such, it enables the user to view sensitive data remotely without the risk of it being stolen or eavesdropped on.
